					<p>
						At the Univeristy of Washignton in the Informatics 200 class,
						"Intellectual Foundations of Information" part of the syllabus is
						for the students to design, research and prototype a product to
						solve a certain problem. We had pretty much free reign as to what we
						could do or tackle. Some groups made smart trashcans for physically
						disabled people, some designed voting apps to inform voters of
						important dates and breakdowns of candidates, and my group wanted to
						tackle mental health on university campuses. Specifically catching
						signs of depression and anxiety early so that we could work on
						proactively helping from the start instead of reacting after the
						fact.
					</p>
					<p>
						We called our app 4U as the app was meant to not stick out if
						someone were to glance at your phone, and it's purpose was all
						centered on "you." In the end mental health is a very personal issue
						and so this was one of our main focuses with the app we were
						developing. The app would allow partnered universities to offer
						access to the application to its students with their student ID, but
						students would be anonymous to everyone. We would offer access to
						message board/chat rooms for a smaller number of people to discuss
						things in their life anonymously, and it would be monitored by a
						professional that could look for signs that a student was anxious or
						depressed or dispel any misinformation that was being spread like
						unhealthy coping mechanisms for example. We would offer games,
						videos for mindfulness, exercise and chilling. We would include a
						journaling feature, goal tracking, verfied information about various
						mental illnesses and a campus specific page with all necessary links
						to resources on campus related to mental illness. A user would also
						have the ability to contact a professional through the app and have
						a one on one chat with them after scheduling it through the app
						itself. All of this would be anonymous, unless there was a specific
						reason the professional felt they should know, or the school or
						otherwise notified. Things such as suicide risks and so on.
					</p>
					<p>
						While we never actually built the app itself, it was a fantastic
						experience to develop an idea, research it, prototype it again and
						again, working from low to high-fidelity and finally presenting it.
						Due to time we never actually got to develop it though into a real
						app.
					</p>
					<p>
						As Java is my main language, I always wanted to attempt to make an
						app that did more than display a random number, or count letters in
						an input string. That's where the idea to actually take all the
						designing and planning we did for 4U and actually build an Android
						app using Android Studio. It would give me a chance to experiment
						with Android Studio, expand my knowledge and abilities as well as
						bring the project to a proper end.
					</p>
					<p>
						Development on this application has been effectively stopped as I realize
						that it is a large project and that there are more effective projects I
						could otherwise tackle. I have also been putting a lot of effort into my
						classes which have had their own projects that have taken up a lot of my
						free time.
