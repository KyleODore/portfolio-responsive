				Interning with FSoft:

					<p>
						My internship with FSoft took place in Tukwila, Washington. Just
						south of Seattle at the Boeing Airfield. I joined the Compliance and
						Analytics team at FSoft that was working on a Web Application for
						Boeing that would help with ensuring their devices were compliant
						with security standards.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was one of my first experiences with NodeJS and I was able to
						become very familiar with Bootstrap, UnderscoreJS, Express and
						DataTables. My main goal was to update the UI and UX for the part of
						the application that most users would visit to be able to digest all
						the information as well as the main table that listed all the
						devices for the airlines that would use the application.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first step was for me to build a high-fidelity prototype
						according to some specifications I was given. I then pitched the
						design to the Lead Developer and Project Manager in the C&A team,
						and after sucessfully doing so my job was to implement the changes.
					</p>
					<p>
						After spending time reading documentation, reading the code, playing
						with, and understanding the application I figured that reading could
						only do so much and I needed to start implementing. As I worked on
						the application understanding the flow of data I realized that one
						of the things my team members forgot to mention was that I would
						need to implement the possibility to lazy-load the data for the
						table, because some airlines might have thousands of devices. The
						test data included an airline that had thousands of rows and without
						any changes would take minutes to load the page.
					</p>
					<p>
						I did choose to focus on other features such as developing an
						intuitive searchbar with added filters to search by, new menu icons,
						and a design that mostly followed material design standards so that
						it would be familiar to new users. When I finally got to
						implementing the lazy loading towards the end of my internship I
						realized that it would require a decent amount of backend work with
						an API.
					</p>
					<p>
						At this point in my knowledge I had not implemented something like
						this before, and I was running out of time. I decided the best thing
						for me to do was to get as far as I could, and lay the ground work
						for future developments. The frontend was all ready to go in terms
						of receiving data and being configured to process it correctly. All
						that needed to be done was to create and call an API to deliver the
						right information.
					</p>
					<p>
						By the end of the internship I felt a lot more comfortable working
						under deadlines and in a professional environment. Especially one at
						the actual Boeing Airfield, where the Museum of Flight was
						practically right across from my building. By far the coolest thing
						to me though was the sense of price and authority that my security
						badge gave me. The responsiblity and officialness (for lack of a
						better word at the moment) that the badge carried was immense and it
						was empowering knowing I was doing meaningful work for a company
						that was globally recognized. Unfortunately due to the secure nature
						of the project I cannot check in on it's progress or be able to see
						what impacts I had on the product. I am content though in the work I
						did and belief that someone someday will or currently is using the
						UI I designed and implemented is why I love working in this
						industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am also grateful that the internship gave me the chance to develop
						my professional Vietnamese and be able to really observe the culture
						at Boeing between the FSoft and Boeing employees as each side were
						from very different backgrounds. Just the fact that the Vietnamese
						employees would always eat together at the same time, across teams,
						while many of the Boeing employees were content with eating with one
						other person or by themselves whenever they had a lull in their
						work. Being a mixed child gave me an interesting opportunity to be a
						middle man in a way that many of the employees couldn't be as they
						were either American, or Vietnamese, but not both.
