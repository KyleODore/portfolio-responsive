						This website has had a trubulent past. I had always wanted to create
						my own portfolio website and have my own creation eventualy show up
						at the top of a Google search for "Kyle O'Dore." But, I was plagued
						with what most developers seem to talk about a lot and that is
						making things too complicated. Originally I wanted to work purely
						with HTML, CSS and JS, but found that the development process was
						too slow. So I put it off. Next, after being exposed to Node, I
						wanted to make an almost webapp-like website, then after working
						with React it was a React based portfolio website. Between each step
						I would realize that I was taking too long, and there were shorter
						ways to do things, but that it could get too complicated and
						unecessary. It took a while for me to realize that I should just
						stick to pure HTML, JS and add on SCSS with Node to find a middle
						ground. After hunkering down, and spending pretty much all my free
						time after work, this website was born.
