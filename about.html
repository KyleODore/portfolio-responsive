						<p>
							Hello, I am Kyle and I'm a graduate of the University of Washington Bothell Campus.
							I was born in Hà Nội, Việt Nam to an American father and Vietnamese
							mother. I have grown up in a diverse range of places from Bangkok,
							Thailand, to Wrentham, Massachussetts, to Hà Nội and Hồ Chí Minh
							City (Sài Gòn), Việt Nam.
						</p>
						<p>
							I originally started my education at the Seattle campus as an Applied Physics major.
							As a kid I was the type to save knick-knacks, from paperclips to broken toys so that
							I could take them apart and tinker with them. I was also the type that was naturally
							drawn to computers so in a tug-of-war compromise I set down the Applied Physics path
							with a focus on Electronics and Quantum Mechanics. However, late into Junior year 
							I transferred to the Bothell campus to pursue their B.S in Computer Science and Software 
							Engineering (CSSE) degree as software engineering aligned more with the types of 
							problems that I wanted to solve.
