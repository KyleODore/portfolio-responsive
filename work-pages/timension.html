					<p>
						Timension is the name of the project that I am currently working on
						for mgm technology partners in Đà Nẵng, Việt Nam. Timension is an
						internal tool that the company is developing to replace antiquated,
						and numerous systems that they currently use. Such systems include a
						employee management system, a 25 year old project and tak management
						system, multiple tools to track employee absences and an HR tool.
					</p>
					<p>
						To fix this the company wanted to use their A12 framework that they
						have developed themselves to build an internal application with it's
						own team that can continually develop and maintain their data and
						system. The application will allow the nearly 800 employees the
						ability to track their working hours, the board and HR to generate
						reports, PMs can track and maintain their projects, employee
						information can be accessed and updated. It will be the one-stop
						shop for the company to manage and view everything they could
						possibly want to within the company, and if there wasn't a way to do
						something, the Timension team could work on their feature in the
						next sprint.
					</p>
					<p>
						My time working with the Timension team has been absolutely amazing,
						from the company culture, to the camaraderie between my co-workers.
						I've been able to work on both the Frontend and Backend and deepen
						my knowledge of Javascript and Java. This internship has also given
						me the chance to work deeply with React, Redux, TypeScript, Spring Boot,
						and JPA. Creating an application as complex and necessary as
						Timension has been a challenge of my ability to write iron-clad code
						and test it to make sure that what I have done hasn't broken other
						things as well as being bug free.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being able to also work and be appreciated as a full member of the
						team, despite being an intern, and being given proper responsibility
						to carry my own weight and be expected to deliver has been amazing.
						It might seem harsh to some being thrown into the pit like that, but
						the team was very forgiving and at one point the most senior
						developer on the team said I should slow down cause he was afraid I
						was simply working, but not fully understanding the system. He was
						partly right and so I learned to take my time and understand the
						implications of the code I was writing and to reason with myself
						whether this implementation was the best now and in the future of
						the application. To also be involved fully in Scrum meetings and
						Agile devleopment, moreso than my previous internship was thrilling
						too. While I understand that there are people out there that do not
						like this Agile developement, I can certainly see the merits and why
						it is so popular in the industry currently.
					</p>
					<p>
						As we near the end of my internship here, the team is working on
						migration from the other systems and while I have tried my best to
						be involved with discussions on the migration and provide input
						where I can. I won't be here when the application goes live, so
						unfortunately I won't be able to see the project in all it's glory
						when it does finally enter production.
