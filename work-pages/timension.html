					<p>
						Timension is the name of the project that I worked on
						for mgm technology partners in Đà Nẵng, Việt Nam. Timension is an
						internal tool that the company is developing to replace numerous
						antiquated systems that they currently use. Such systems include a
						employee management system, a 25 year old project and task management
						system, multiple tools to track employee absences, and an HR tool.
					</p>
					<p>
						The previous time tracking system only had one developer that maintained
						and developed the system. To fix this the company wanted to use their A12 framework that they
						have developed themselves to build an internal application with its
						own team that can continually develop and maintain their data and
						system. The application allows the nearly 800 employees the
						ability to track their working hours, the board and HR to generate
						reports, PMs can track and maintain their projects, employee
						information can be accessed and updated. It is the one-stop
						shop for the company to manage and view everything they could
						possibly want to within the company, and if there wasn't a way to do
						something, the Timension team could work on their feature in an
						upcoming sprint.
					</p>
					<p>
						My time working with the Timension team was absolutely amazing,
						from the company culture, to the camaraderie between my co-workers.
						I was able to work on both the Frontend and Backend and deepen
						my knowledge of Javascript, SQL, and Java. This internship gave
						me the chance to work deeply with React, Redux, TypeScript, Spring Boot,
						and JPA. Creating an application as complex and necessary as
						Timension was a challenge of my ability to write iron-clad code
						and test it thoroughly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being able to also work and be appreciated as a full member of the
						team, despite being an intern, and being given proper responsibility
						to carry my own weight and be expected to deliver was amazing.
						It was harsh at first being thrown into the pit like that, but
						the team was very forgiving and gave me the resources to find my 
						stride and develop myself into an effective team member. Eventually
						the senior developer on the team said I should slow down cause he was afraid I
						was simply working, but not fully understanding the system. I realized
						he was right and so I learned to slow down and understand the
						implications of the code I was writing and how it fit into the system's function.
						I learned that it is very easy to try and hack together a solution that
						works and also at the same time learn nothing new.
					</p>
					<p>
						To also be involved fully in Scrum meetings and
						Agile devleopment, moreso than my previous internship was thrilling
						too. While I understand that there are people out there that do not
						like Agile developement, I can certainly see the merits and why
						it is so popular in the industry currently with the rising need for
						software to be developed quickly in an internet age that moves even faster.
					</p>
					<p>
						Towards the end of my internship, the team was working on
						migration from the other systems. While I tried my best to
						be involved with discussions on the migration and provide input
						where I can. I was not there when the application went live, so
						unfortunately I can't see the project in all it's glory even though
						it is now live.
