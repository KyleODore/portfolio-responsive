					<p>
						Java Fiddling is a repository that I am building to somewhat emulate
						the Algorithms Repository on Github currently. As I have been
						reading through Steven Skiena's brilliant "The Algorithm Design
						Manual," I have been keeping an ever growing list of Data Structures
						and Algorithms that I'd like to implement myself and try to optimize
						over time. This would allow me to foster a deeper understanding of
						these concepts in a way that simply using them would not afford.
					</p>
					<p>
						This repository is a CLI based application that would 
						allow me to run an algorithm on datasets I'd provide and can modify
						in the source code. I would also be able to choose a data structure
						that the algorithm would use to see and experiment with the
						real-time difference that a data structure can make on an algorithms
						runtime.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, this project has been put on the backburner as I have ended
						up implementing a lot of these data structures and algorithms in both 
						Java and C++ through coursework. I cannot upload the code for those
						assignments to this page in case a student tries to copy my code for 
						themselves. I will however detail the projects in other posts here on
						the My Work page.
