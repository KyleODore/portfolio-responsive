					<p>
						Java Fiddling is a repository that I am building to somewhat emulate
						the Algorithms Repository on Github currently. As I have been
						reading through Steven Skiena's brilliant "The Algorithm Design
						Manual," I have been keeping an ever growing list of Data Structures
						and Algorithms that I'd like to implement myself and try to optimize
						over time. This would allow me to foster a deeper understanding of
						these concepts in a way that simply using them would not afford. I
						will not be able to develop a faster algorithm that what is
						currently available, but maybe I will stumble across something
						completely new (despite odds being against me), and worst case I
						will gain a deeper respect for the current existing implementations.
						This repository is a CLI based application that would basically
						allow me to run an algorithm on datasets I'd provide and can modify
						in the source code. I would also be able to choose a data structure
						that the algorithm would use to see and experiment with the
						real-time difference that a data structure can make on an algorithms
						runtime.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, this project has been put on the backburner and I will
						most likely pick it back up after I have made considerable progress
						with my project to create an actual Android application "4U," that I had helped
						prototype and design.
