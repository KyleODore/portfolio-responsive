					<p>
						This website has had a trubulent past. I had always wanted to create
						my own portfolio website and have my own creation eventualy show up
						at the top of a Google search for "Kyle O'Dore." But, I was plagued
						with what most developers seem to talk about a lot and that is
						making things too complicated, overengineering. Originally I wanted to work purely
						with HTML, CSS and JS, but found that the development process was
						too slow. So I put it off. Next, after being exposed to Node, I
						wanted to make an almost webapp-like website, then after working
						with React it was a React based portfolio website. Between each step
						I would realize that I was taking too long, and there were shorter
						ways to do things, but that it could get too complicated and
						unecessary. It took a while for me to realize that I should just
						stick to pure HTML, JS and add on SCSS with Node to find a middle
						ground. After hunkering down, and spending pretty much all my free
						time after work, this website was born.
					</p>
					<p>
						The purpose of this website is for me to create a hub on the
						internet where information about me is collated for people
						interested in learning about me, or what I have done. All my contact
						details, resume, projects all in one spot for recruiters, fellow
						developers or future colleagues. Being a static page it requires a
						bit more hands on work and maintainance, but it is a good start for
						me and leaves me more time to focus on more meaningful projects
						which can also be found on the "My Work" page.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even now working, on this page itself and the other project pages,
						my brain is constantly trying to look for things to improve and
						features to add. It's an endless process and I love seeing pages
						come together and know that I will be leaving a mark on the
						internet.
